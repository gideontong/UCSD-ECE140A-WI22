# Lab 1

## Tutorials

### Tutorial 1: Git

In this tutorial we learned how to use Git. Since I'm already a Git user, I didn't set it up again. However, during this time I did set up commit signing so I will be signing my commits using GPG.

### Tutorial 2: Python Install & Setup

In this tutorial we learned to setup Python. I already use Python and I'm not a fan of Anaconda, nor am I a fan of the Spyder IDE, so I'll be using my own setup. This consists of a virtual environment in Python 3.9.5 using Visual Studio Code.

### Tutorial 3: Python Basics

In this tutorial we learned about the basics of Python: functions, looping, immutable strings, slicing, list comprehensions, data types, and more. I already have experience with Python so this is all pretty familiar to me.

### Tutorial 4: Web Scraping

In this tutorial we learned about web scraping. We used modules like `requests` and `BeautifulSoup4` to do web scraping and processing and we also learned about potential ways to prevent web scraping.

## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Welcome to my portfolio!

1. `ANS1` No it's not an HTML tag, it is there so the browser knows what to expect.
2. `ANS2` The title bar on the top of the browser changed (default name for bookmarks).
3. `ANS3` Tags are enclosed so that content within tags the browser knows to render it in a hierarchal format.
4. `ANS4.1` It changed after I inspected it but after I refreshed the changes went back to the way they were before.
5. `ANS4.2` Now that I make the changes in the HTML I see the changes because the changes have been written to disk (file changes).

The two changes I made was the extra change (additional icons at the bottom of the page), and a really annoying marquee at the top and bottom of the page.

### Challenge 2: Scraping the Web with BeautifulSoup

1. In which year did Barack Obama get the Nobel Peace Prize?

> 2009

2. When and for what did Ernest Rutherford win the Nobel Prize?

> Ernest Rutherford, Chemistry, 1908, "for his investigations into the disintegration of the elements, and the chemistry of radioactive substances"

3. Who got the prize for Physics in 1939?

> Ernest Orlando Lawrence

In this challenge we learned about web scraping. I did all my work in the Jupyter Notebook.
