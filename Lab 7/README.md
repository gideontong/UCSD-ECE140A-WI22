## Tutorials

### Tutorial 1: Say Cheese!

I learned how to take a photo in this tutorial and save the captured image on the filesystem. Now whenever I run the code I can see the photo that I just took! The photo was not too dark for me.

### Tutorial 2: Sudoku Solver

This is a Sudoku solver that we learned to use using tesseract. It recognizes the numbers in the sudoku grid and then solves the sudoku otherwise.

## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Number Plate Recognition on Pi

I used pytesseract to detect the license plates and write the license plate out from the function to a file for additional processing. It was a great learning experience.
