## Tutorials

### Tutorial 1: MySQL Python Connector

In this tutorial I learned how to use MySQL with Python, and how to query MySQL databases and create them and run commands and execute them with Python. I learned about how we can all do this programatically.

### Tutorial 2: RESTful Databases

In this tutorial I learned about templating and how I can render HTML websites simply by using templates so that I don't have to manually write out the HTML and I can serve dynamic content in this way, for the end user to enjoy.

### Tutorial 3: A fully functional website

In this tutorial I learned how to create a fully functional website from start to finish. I learned about creating the routes and the endpoints that people could see and get served using the HTML templates and how I could also load Javascript into these files.
