## Tutorials

### Tutorial 1: Installing MySQL

In this tutorial we learned how to install MySQL, and then we watched a lecture in which we had to follow a tutorial and create various tutorial queries for creating, deleting, inserting into, selecting, and updating tables. 

### Tutorial 2: Creating Tables from CSVs

I learned how to dump a table from a CSV into an SQL database, so we could easily import and export data based on whatever we were given. This will be useful for exchanging data with my peers.

### Tutorial 3: Introduction to Queries with SQL

I prepared my songs imported database that was given to me in the previous tutorial and I learned about how to create different kinds of queries for advanced SELECT.

## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Querying the Song Table

I wrote a bunch of SQL queries for this challenge. I did have to do some looking up on W3 schools in order to craft some of the SQL queries.

### Challenge 2: Simpsons Database

In this challenge we created and imported a bunch of CSVs representing courses, grades, students and teachers. I manipulated the SQL commands in various ways.
